# Video Game Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a Video Game Recommendation System developed as part of 
a Data Science workshop at the Open University of Israel (2025). 
The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests video games users are most likely to purchase, 
utilizing Amazon's 2023 Video Game Reviews dataset.

# Project Overview

The recommendation system is designed to provide personalized game recommendations based on user interactions, sentiment analysis, and item embeddings.


# Objective

* Primary Goal: Recommend the top 10 games for each user, with a high probability of purchase.
* Key Evaluation Metric: Hit Rate â€” ensuring that at least one recommended game appears in the test set purchases.

# Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Amazon Reviews 2023](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/), specifically the Video Games category.
